# This is Readme.MD file for MongoDB Training

I took MongoDB DatBase training from Mongo University by Mr Andrew Erlichson
in January-February 2016
and part of training was writing code in python to learn MongoDB database
This course I completed successfully during these TWO months with 90% points
It was fun while learning MongoDB DataBase.
I also learnt a litlle more about python and Modern DataBases like MongoDB
The Goal was to make a website using MongoDB as DB and python as PL and bottle package
to manage website.
Please take  look at the programs I wrote in M101P directory.
A lot of material was provided by Instructor Mr Andrew Erlichson from MongoDB Univ
and I changed/updated the code to achive the desired results and wrote a few new programs of my own as well.
Thanks
