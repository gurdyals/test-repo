I took one of the Folders from my Personal emails "INBOX" to do data analysis after taking
Dr Chuck's Capstone Project on Coursera " Python for Everybody "
Following are the Files I took from Dr Chuck's class "1)d3.layout.cloud.js 2)d3.v2.js 3)dword.htm & 4)d1word.htm"
to create visualisation of the extracted data in a particular format.
Python Program I wrote is :
1)read_INBOX.py
and the Output is :
1)dword.js(contains First part of email address) 2)d1word.js(contains domain name from email)
Thanks
